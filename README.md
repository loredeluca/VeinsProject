# VeinsProject
Project on the Vehicular Adhoc Network based on information propagation delay with and without RSU.
This software provides a study on the distribution patterns of critical information in vehicle networks (VANET). In particular, the max delay and average RSSI of transmission of potential danger messages in urban and extra-urban contexts between vehicles and roadside units are analyzed.
